    <ul>
      <li>child processes and parent processed. <code>fork()</code> to create a child process from parent process. All content, including the executing program is copied from parent process to child process. To distinguish current process, for parent process, <code>fork()</code> returns pid of child process and for child process, <code>fork()</code> returns 0. Usually, the process spawn procedure is used to perform different task. So <code>exec()</code> is needed and usually used on child process. By using <code>exec()</code>, child process would execute another program and copied content will be lost. However, at this moment, the parent process still needs to use <code>wait()</code> to fetch the exit status of child process and handle its memory allocation after the termination of child process.</li>
      <li>container three requirements: isolation, abstraction and memory constraints. If you want to implement container this logic on linux, what operations linux provide to achieve above three requirements?
If you find related operations, you could directly achieve container on linux. For example, isolation could use <code>privileges</code>, abstraction could use <code>chroot</code> and memory constraint could use <code>rlimit</code>.</li>
      <li>Unix systems have a single directory tree. All accessible storage must have an associated location in this single directory tree. Mounting is the act of associating a storage device to a particular location in the directory tree.  Let&#39;s say the CD-ROM device is /dev/cdrom and the chosen mount point is /media/cdrom. The corresponding command is <code>mount /dev/cdrom /media/cdrom</code>. After that command is run, a file whose location on the CD-ROM is <code>/dir/file</code> is now accessible on your system as <code>/media/cdrom/dir/file</code>. When you&#39;ve finished using the CD, you run the command <code>umount /dev/cdrom</code> or <code>umount /media/cdrom</code> (both will work; typical desktop environments will do this when you click on the “eject” or ”safely remove” button).</li>
<li><code>chroot</code> change the root directory of a process.</li>
    <li><code>git status</code> to check files&#39; status. <code>git add file_1 file_2</code> to put some files into staging area. <code>git commit -m &quot;message&quot;</code> to create a commit with message. Finally, use <code>git push -u origin master</code> to push all changes to master branch on remote servers. After the above flow, if you wanna track changes in master branch, use <code>git pull origin master</code> to fetch newest content to local. Local content will go missing. (Personal repository might  have <strong>main</strong> branch not <strong>master</strong> branch. )</li>
      <li>CGI script <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">a</span> running script <span class="hljs-keyword">on</span> web servers that use user <span class="hljs-built_in">input</span> data <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">input</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">and</span> output html <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> feedback <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> users. It <span class="hljs-built_in">has</span> been replaced.</li>
