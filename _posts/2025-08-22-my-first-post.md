The ratings of the horror films are normally lower than other categories. Interestingly, the rating will be lower if it is scary, and still be lower if it is not scary.
I enjoy the scene in the horror films and thus collect some entries that are good to watch or even rewatch in my opinion:
- Terrified 2017，[Douban 6.7](https://movie.douban.com/subject/27188152/)，[IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7549892)
- The Wailing 2016，[Douban 7.3](https://movie.douban.com/subject/25817534/)，[IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5215952)
- Silent Hill 2006，[Douban 7.7](https://movie.douban.com/subject/1466007/). [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0384537/)
